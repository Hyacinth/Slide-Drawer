Slide-Drawer
============

iOS category for UINavigationController which enables a view belonging to a UINavigationController to act as a drawer.

Slide Drawer is a simple drawer implementation which takes a screenshot of the current view controller, pushes the "bottom" drawer view controller into view, and overlays the screenshot of the previous view controller to simulate a drawer.
